# RocketChat-HTMLExport
Python script for exporting RocketChat messages and files

## Windows
A binary for Windows users [is available](https://github.com/AGrillenberger/RocketChat-HTMLExport/releases/download/v1-win32/rocket-history.zip) - just download it, unpack it and run ```rocket-history.exe```

Alternatively, Windows users can of course also use the method described below for Linux and MacOS if they have python installed.

## MacOS and Linux
This method requires Python3 and [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) installed. If this is the case, just the requirements for the script have to be installed and the script can be executed.

## Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
```
python3 rocket-history.py
